# Privacy Policy - Heb@AR App 
This document is intended to inform users of the Heb@AR App of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information should anyone choose to use our App.

If you choose to use the Heb@AR App, you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Storage and processing of user-related data.
In order to facilitate your use of our service, it is necessary to provide us with certain personal data, including but not limited to your first and last name. We will not retain the information we request and will only use it as described in this Privacy Policy. The first and last name will only be used to identify participants/users to each other in multi-user trainings and will not be stored and/or analyzed by us.

**The app collects data with the sole purpose of improving the app itself and not for commercial purposes. When the app is first launched, the user is asked to consent to data collection. In doing so, reference is made to the Unity Data Privacy Policy. The data collected includes various types of information. This includes user and session data, as well as specific data about events related to the app, different scenarios, and devices used. In order to protect user privacy, all data collected is pseudonymized.**.

**During augmented reality training, "training evaluations" are collected at the end and transmitted pseudonymously. These evaluations are not stored locally on the device. Their main purpose is to provide the user with a reflection opportunity and to improve the training experience. No personal data is stored or analyzed in connection with these evaluations.**.

**The data collected is used exclusively to improve the app. It is used to fix bugs, optimize performance, and improve the overall user experience. No data is shared with third parties unless there is a legal obligation to do so.**


The app uses third-party services that may collect information that can identify you. Links to the third-party privacy policies used by the App are as follows:

### Security
We appreciate that you entrust us with your personal information, so we strive to protect it through commercially acceptable means. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure or reliable, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### Use of the camera
This service uses the device's camera to display AR content in the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to allow the device to access the camera. Access to the camera is used solely for the purpose of displaying the images or videos on your device's screen and overlaying the AR content. No image or video data is sent or stored to us. The app does not share image data with us or third parties.

### Links to other websites
This service may contain links to other websites. When you click on a third party link, you will be redirected to that site. Please note that these external websites are not necessarily operated by us. We therefore strongly encourage you to read the privacy policies of those websites. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services.

### Privacy for children
These services are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it from our servers immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and know that your child has provided us with personally identifiable information, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Therefore, we encourage you to check this page periodically for changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.


This policy is effective as of 4th September 2023.
